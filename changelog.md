# CFM Change Log
All notable changes to the Community Firn Model should be documented in this file. Contributors to the CFM who are unfamiliar with changelogs should review the notes at the end of this document.

TL;DR: Write down the changes that you made to the the model in this document and update the version number here and in main.py, then update master on github.

## Current Version
1.0.4

## Work in progress and known issues

- *Issues* 
	- Morris physics do not work properly.
	- If data is not written at each time step, dH that is saved/written to file does not represent the change since the last write. 

- *Work in progress*
	- V. Verjans is working on a percolation module that solves Richard's equation and includes a dual-domain approach to handle preferential flow
	- Documentation for the CFM
	- Goujon physics work, but could possibly be implemented more elegantly (it would be nice to avoid globals)
	- Not exactly in progress, but at some point adding a log file that gets saved in the results folder would be a good idea.

## [1.0.5] -

### Fixed
- *physics.py* Barnola physics had an error where the exponent *n* for zone 2 densification was always 3; it should be 1 (and now is) when the stress is less than 0.1 MPa.

## [1.0.4] - 2019-07-17
### Notes
- This release includes several components: I fixed implementation of Morris and Wingham (2014) physics, changed how mean temperature is calculated, added a corrected/modified DH calculation, and changed how T10m is calculated. There may be a few things (e.g. random print statements) that are hanging around. I am still working on implementing V. Verjans melt schemes.

### Changed
- *physics.py, firn_density_spin.py, firn_density_nospin.py* A number of the models use the mean annual surface temperature in their calculations (e.g. the Arthern family, Li and Zwally). On short time scales, this is generally equal to the mean of the entire temperature input. In longer simulations it changes through time. self.T_mean is now calculated at the beginning of firn_density_nospin as the mean temperature of the last 10 years. This should be quite close to the value of T10m if there is no melt. I am still working on how to implement this; it currently uses a Hamming filter with pandas 'rolling' feature. 
- *diffusion.py* T10m previously used an interpolation to find the temperature at 10m exactly; it now is just the temperature at the first node at 10m depth or greater. It should be slightly faster.
- *physics.py* I fixed how the Morris and Wingham (2014) model was coded. There was an error in the original text. I fixed it based on correspondence with L. Morris in May 2019. Email me (maxstev@uw.edu) if you want more detail; it will be published in a forthcoming paper.
- *firn_density_nospin.py* DH is calculated based on compaction at each time step, the thickness of the new snow layer, and the thickness of ice (called *iceout* in the model) that is removed at each time step. If the bottom of the model domain is less than ice density, the CFM did not account for the additional compaction that occured between the bottom of the firn and the ice (917) density horizon. I added a 2 new fields, DHcorr and DHcorrC, that is added to the 'DIP' model output, which mirror the previous fields DH and DHc (elevation change since last time step and cumulative since begining of when output begins writing).

## [1.0.3] - 2019-05-13
### Notes
- This release fixes several bugs. (I am working on implementing V. Verjan's preferential flow melt routine; there are several things that may you may notice related to that in this release, e.g. a note about 'merging' and 'Reeh01' in the .json file. This will be fixed in version 1.0.4.)

### Changed
- *physics.py* HLSigfus was changed slightly so that boolean masks are created for the different zones, which makes the code easier to read. HLdynamic (instant version) was changed so that in the case of negative accumulation, A_instant is set to zero.
- *firn_density_nospin.py* Changed dH calculation to set to be zero at the first write time step.
- *firn_density_nospin.py* Added **comp_firn** as an additional variable written with DIP. It is the total firn compaction during the previous time step, not including the ice dynamics or new accumulation (i.e. the summed thickness change of all of the layers).
- *firn_density_nospin.py* Variable **crate_out** has been changed to **comp_out** to reflect that it is just compaction, not the rate.
- *writer.py* Output name has changed from 'compaction_rate' to 'compaction'
- *firn_density_nospin.py and firn_density_spin.py* Changed the 'SeasonalTCycle' feature to exit model run if turned on and hemisphere is not selected.

### Fixed
- *constants.py* Latent heat and specific heat were incorrectly converted to kJ units - fixed, and values were changed to be consistent with Cuffey and Paterson. Note that specific heat changes with temperature; it can be set to reflect that in diffusion.py (Thanks to Jiajin Chen and Gang Hai for pointing this out.)
- *firn_density_spin.py* the seasonalTcycle feature was hard coded to be only for Greenland (it had been updated to be modular in firn_density_nospin) - now 'spin' matches 'nospin'.
- *melt.py*, in def percolation_bucket: The compaction output was incorrect because the partial melt (PM) was given a new thickness (in dzn) of zero. Fixed so that the boxes the melt entirely get a value of zero in dzn but the PM box gets its new thickness after melt
- *general* Running the example, using example.json, did not work because bdot_type was set in it to instant, and the example smb file contains a negative value. firn_density_nospin.py now prints an error and exits if this happens and example.json is set to bdot_type = 'mean'.

### Added
- *physics.py, firn_density_nospin.py, writer.py* Added code to calculate the firn viscosity predicted by each model and optionally write that to file (Brita Horlings contribution).
- *firn_density_nospin.py* Added Li2015, which uses a different value for beta than Li and Zwally 2011.
- *firn_density_spin.py* Added 'manualclimate', which must also be added to .json file to use. It allows the user to set the long-term temperature and accumulation rate manually; helpful e.g. in the case of short model runs.
- *firn_density_nospin.py* Added 'manual_iceout', which must also be added to .json file to use. It allows the user to set the long-term ice-dynamic thinning manually, e.g. the vertical ice velocity at the bottom of the firn column; helpful e.g. if it is different than the mean accumulation rate for the modeled period.
- *example.json* several new fields were added.

### Removed
- *melt.py* Max's original bucket scheme, which did not work well, was removed.

## [1.0.2] - 2019-02-08
### Fixed
- *diffusion.py* The enthalpy method has been redone using a source-based method. The code is based on work from Voller and Swaminathan, 1990. The function in diffusion.py is called enthalpyDiff(). The prior code is still there (for now) and is called enthalpyDiff_old. 

### Added
- *melt.py*: An additional bucket scheme, coded by Vincent Verjans, has been added. It is meant to be used with standard heat diffusion. Testing is underway to use it with the enthalpy diffusion method. To use this method (for now) you need to comment/uncomment in firn_density_nospin.py.

### Changed
- *diffusion.py, solver.py*: Previously, Gamma_P in diffusion.py was defined as `Gamma_P = K_firn / (c_firn)`. This, however, assumes that c_firn is constant, but it is not (varies with temperature). Now, `Gamma_P = K_firn`. A new variable, c_vol, is added - it is the heat capacity: `c_vol = rho * c_firn`. This comes into solver.py where a_P_0 is defined: previously it was `a_P_0 = tot_rho * dZ / dt`, but now it is `a_P_0 = c_vol * dZ / dt`.

- *plotter.py*: Changed to be simpler and more generic.

## [1.0.1] - 2018-11-05
### Added

- User can now initialize the model using density and temperature measurements, rather than using the firn profile predicted by the spin-up climate. Two fields need to be added to the .json file. The .csv file with the input data is column-wise. The first column is depth, the second is density, and the third is temperature.
	- *example.json*: field **"initfirnFile"**, (filename.csv)
	- *example.json*: field **"initprofile"**, (true/false)

- There is now an option to write refrozen and runoff (*writer.py*)

- *example.json*: field **"SeasonalThemi"**, (north/south), which specifies the hemisphere that the model run is simulating. This only works in concert with with SeasonalTCycle: true
- *example.json*: field **"coreless"**, (true/false): if SeasonalTCycle: true and hemisphere is south, the user can choose to implement a 'coreless winter' seasonal temperature cycle.

- *All files:* Added #/usr/bin/env python at start
- *All files:* Converted all tabs to spaces (python standard)

### Fixed

- There was an issue that during time steps with no accumulation self.dzNew was not set to zero, leading to the model over-predicting surface-elevation changes when there are small time steps (i.e. many with zero accumulation). Thanks to Brooke Medley for pointing this out.

## Contributor notes
A changelog is meant to keep a record of changes that are made to software. Any changes made should be recorded here. When you are working on the code, I recommend keeping this file open and logging changes as you make them. You should (1) keep a version of changelog.md that is exclusive to your branch and (2) keep a running list at the top of what features you are working on. When you push your code to master, update this file (i.e. the version on your branch) to reflect what it should look like on the master branch.

If the changes are pushed to the master branch, the version should be updated. 

Changes should be categorized into *Added*, *Changed*, *Deprecated*, *Removed*, or *Fixed*. Because there are numerous files in the CFM that can be changed, the affected file should be listed in italics prior to the change when appropriate. E.g.

- *constants.py* Added specific heat of water

Changes to the .json files (most frequently new fields that are added to the configuration .json files) should be updated in the file generic.json, as then recorded in this document specifying the addition/change, e.g.

- *example.json* Added field **initprofile**, (true/false) which specifies whether to use an initial condition from depth/density/temperature measurements, rather than a spin up climate

### Versioning
Any push to the master branch should get a new version, which should be changed in main.py as well as in this changelog and readme.md. Small changes warrant changing the version in the 3rd digit (i.e. 1.0.X), and larger changes warrant changing the 2nd digit (i.e. 1.X.0). I am not sure what a version 2 of the CFM would look like.

I used information from [KeepAChangeLog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for this document.

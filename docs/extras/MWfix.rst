Morris and Wingham (2014) fix
=============================

The Morris and Wingham (2014) paper describes a firn-densification model derived from repeat high-vertical-resolution borehole density logs. There was an error in that paper, which Liz Morris alerted me to. She sent a corrected description of the model, which you can download here.
